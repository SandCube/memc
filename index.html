            "Answer": ["No. It is temporary casting",
                "Green sand is actually black and is used for sand casting.",
                "When metal is poured through the runner, it will eventually come out through the riser. The purpose of the riser is to give an indication that the molten metal has flown through all the cavities of cast. Once the casted part has hardened, the riser is cut off; therefore its scrap metal.",
    "Steel. A die is a mold made from metal. Occasionally it is also made from graphite (see bottom of pg. 25)",
    "No. Investment casting is a temporary casting.",
    "Centrifugal casting is used for cylindrical shapes.",
    "Continuous casting is the process whereby molten steel is solidified into a billet, bloom, or slab for subsequent rolling in the finishing mills. Metal is passed through a reservoir called tundish where it sits for some time to collect slag. Metal then flows continuously thru a mold called a strand which is water cooled at the walls and has no bottom. The metal flows out with a continuous length and an outside surface that has hardened just enough to retain its shape. A secondary cooling stage consists of spraying the casted part with water so that the metal solidifies throughout the entire cross section. The part then goes through a set of guide and straightening rolls and is later cut to desired lengths.",
    "The minimum thickness is 3mm.",
    "No, the walls should contain a taper of 1-3 degrees for ease of removal of pattern from mold.",
    "Residual stress is stress that is left over once the external cause (ex. force) has been removed. There is more residual stress left over from cold working than hot working because cold working requires a greater force. Also because hot working is done above the recrystallization temperature.",
    "Reentrant shape should be avoided, can be easily altered by changing the shape of the cast part.",
